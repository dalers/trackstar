This is the code from the book [Web Application Development with Yii and PHP 2nd edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-application-development-yii-and-php), by Jeff Winesett.

The chapter directories included with the book have been re-organized using git, with each chapter a new commit. I did this so I could use Git tools (e.g. Git Extensions) to analyze code changes between chapters.
